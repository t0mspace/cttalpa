== Description ==

This plugin can make(convert) the paths(URLs) to relative instead of absolute. This plugin is useful to using the relative URLs. The given below list of permalinks and src can be easily converted to relative:

* Post Permalinks
* Archive Permalinks
* Author Permalinks
* Category Permalinks
* Scripts Paths(src) 
* Styles Paths(src)
* Image Paths(src)

All the above permalinks and src can be converted to relative instead absolute by using this plugin. You can select the options from the plugin settings page. 

= Filters =

If you want to exclude some Permalink or src to be relative so, you can use `paths_relative` filter in your theme's functions.php or in your custom plugin.

Your filter may looks like this (Below filter would make the jquery.js Path to absolute):

`
function yasglobal_change_path( $link ) {
  if( $link == '/wp-includes/js/jquery/jquery.js?ver=1.12.4' ) {
    $link = site_url().'/wp-includes/js/jquery/jquery.js?ver=1.12.4';
  }
  return $link;
}
add_filter( 'paths_relative', 'yasglobal_change_path' );
`

If you doesn't want to Make the Paths relative for srcset(Responsive Images)
so, just add this line in your theme's functions.php.

`
add_filter( 'srcset_paths_relative', '__return_false' );
`

If you want to make plugin works and all the paths relative without going to
check/visit Settings Page so, just add this line in your theme's functions.php.

`
add_filter( 'make_paths_relative_activate_all', '__return_true' );
